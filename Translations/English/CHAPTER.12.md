## 12. What extreme advantage do you have as an ordinary person?

Say it again:

> It is absolutely feasible for you to depend on yourself to fixed investment without any exaggeration. The **ordinary people** mentioned here are regardless of national boundaries, regardless of region, regardless of race, regardless of gender, regardless of age, regardless of height, weight, thinness, beauty, ugliness, regardless of sexual orientation... And even IQ and education do not make any difference!

When I repeat this part of speech, I am reminding you of a fact that you did not expect:

> As an ordinary person, you have at least one **extreme advantage** that all ordinary people have - **it is just that you never thought about it.**

As an ordinary person, you have the advantage that all the so-called professional fund managers in the market can't have:

> **Although your money is not much, your money is without time limitation.**

The vast majority of so-called professional analysis, articles, and even even some concepts in the market are completely ineffective for you as an ordinary person, because those professional fund managers are based on a practical limit they have to face to further conduct research and reach conclusions. What must they face? It is the money of the fund, and the money managed by the fund managers is **time-limited** . Almost all active funds have a settlement period, such as 7+3 or 5+2 that you often hear, or even 2+1 in the country. Because their capital use period is certain, their starting point is completely different. What they must do is to run a good result in a time period. Otherwise, it will not be next time!

You are different as an ordinary person. Although you don't seem to have a lot of money, you can continue to invest, you can hold it for a long time. As for how long it is, it is up to you to decide it – this is the extreme advantage, which is the root cause of your qualification. .

The vast majority of active management funds in the market have no Regular Investment grids - because of the time limit for the funds they manage, the conditions are completely unacceptable. Even if they are smart, no matter how witty, they will eventually fall to the point where they basically decide their own destiny by the fund raising time. If the fundraising is successful in the process of bottoming out in a cycle, then the fund is a good life – it is really hard to raise money in a bear market! It is said that "There is no grain in the landlord's house." And most of the funds that have been able to start fundraising because of the bull market, and have finally been in the tail of the bull market when they finally succeeded in their collection, have determined their tragic fate from the moment of birth - whether it is a probability decision to hold the cycle, the decisive factor is not within the active boundary at all, and not even connects to the passive force at all...

I know that you can't believe it. I guess you are thinking, "How can it be such a factor that can be called an extreme advantage?"

Many people like to read Warren Buffett's article, his letter to shareholders, his speech, the books he compiled, and I also like to read them. If you have nothing to do, you can take these articles out... However, most people may misunderstood the starting point of Buffett to a large extent.

Because most people don't care or don't notice an important fact and foundation:

> Buffett’s money for investing now is with zero or even negative costs! Because most of that comes from the relative no-time-limit money provided by his own insurance company!

When numerous Buffett’s ideas, principles, or philosophies, the basic facts are often completely ignored. In the world of actively managed funds, few people can have such superiority and even luxury investment condition and foundation as Buffett!

However, if you change your mind, you will understand that as long as you have a correct attitude, you actually have the same extreme advantage as Buffett.

> - You are determined to continually hone your ability to make money off the court. In theory, the more practice it should endure, the stronger it should be;
> - The money you earn on the side of the field is equally cost-free, and your time and effort are not in vain;
> - For simple calculations, you only need to ensure that you are healthy for the next ten years and you have defeated the investment managers of almost all active management funds on the planet...

The essence and principle behind this extreme advantage actually comes from the active boundary:

> - You start to fixed investment as an ordinary person, then almost all the decisive factors can be mastered passively;
> - Those who are so-called professionals are terrible - all the factors that they face, whether important or not, which are within their own active boundaries, are too little...

So, you understand, as mentioned in #9.7, you have to carefully examine how much space do you have in your active boundaries? Because you already know clearly, this is definitely the place where you need to struggle the most. In this place, your advantage has a lot of room to play. All the struggles you have made here have great value in the future. It is even a direct wealth.

The thing you may not think the most is that the biggest resistance of ordinary people always comes from family.

Tell you an urban horror story:

> More than a decade ago, I occasionally heard that two middle-level cadres of a large company were discussing how to let their subordinates obey:
> > —— Hey, How do you make them so obedient? I am really frustrating!
> > - Isn't that simple yet? Organize the wife group to go to see the house together! I tell you, don't look at how haughty they are in front of you, as long as they bought a house and pay the down payment today, tomorrow they will definitely become as humble as your grandson!

This is what I can cite that the family is often the most horrifying example of the greatest resistance of ordinary people. Do you feel it?

Ordinary people have **extreme advantages** , but ordinary people also have **extreme disadvantages**: we can not care about the whole world, but we must care about family members, right? Even if they don't necessarily make sense, don't they? If you are sick, you have to take care of them, and you have to worry about it. These are all small things. But when you make major decisions, why are family members always in a state of obstruction?

The key point is that the **vast majority of ordinary people have not honed their true ability to persuade people.** To explain a principle, make a clear statement, and be able to express it to the other party accurately, and them make a logical and complete explanation for each other's various questions is not something that can be mastered overnight.

As you get older, it will become easier and easier to convince your parents, but it is getting harder or harder to convince your spouse. The most difficult historical problem for most ordinary people is that when they chose their spouse, what they were paying attention to was basically the other person’s appearance, body figure, family, and other trivial things. The real core factor has never been considered: Is the **other person a person who can reasonably communicate?**

In my own experience, the most grateful thing is that my wife is a person who can communicate through reasoning. Although when we were together in the beginning, I didn't know that this was the most important factor - you see, I always exclaim that I am lucky, but there is really a reason.

Sometimes our different opinions would be very serious, but after a bit of disappointment, after a while, or a few hours, or even for overnight, one of us will take the initiative to find the other person, "After I carefully think about it, what you said here and here is still very reasonable... Then, there is something I can't understand, or do you try again with patience?" - Assuming that if without such a spouse and such proper communication, you said to your other half like what I did, "I will not accompany you for your birthday, I have to work!" Try? Don't try it at all? You will know what it will be!

The trick in a sentence is:

> **You have to share your ideals with your family.**

If so, it is extremely easy to communicate. The way I use it is, I will try my best to let the other person understand the great meaning of doing something to me, and think about whether the great meaning is equally great for the other party? If it is only useful to me, then forget it. If it is the same for the other party, why not communicate with the other person?

In fact, we have mentioned that there are actually few really important decisions in a person’s life. If you really understand every detail of the investment strategy and its principles and power, in the end, you will find a fact: as long as it is a major decision, you can adopt a Regular Investment strategy. Education, family, career, which one can not apply a Regular Investment strategy? If you really understand the essence of the Regular Investment, you will find that no matter who you are, no matter how ordinary you are, you can do education, family, career well, because the method of doing it is very simple, decided to fixed invest! However, this investment target has been changed. For the purpose of studying, the method of Regular Investment is to eventually generate the ones that are growing over the whole life; for the family and the family members, by using the method of definite investment, then the happiness can only be more and more consolidated; for the career, you actually use the method of Regular Investment. How could others be better than you without the essence of the investment? **The so-called comprehending by analogy is the case.**
