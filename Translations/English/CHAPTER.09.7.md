## 9. The profound mechanism behind the magical power of the Regular Investment strategy

Let us start with a pair of concepts that seem to be opposite:

> **Active** and **Passive**

In general, active and passive are considered to be antonyms. “Active” is generally understood to be positive, while relatively “passive” is often understood as negative.

### 9.7 How much space do you have within the active boundaries?

As mentioned before, " **anything that has a major impact on you is not something you can control.** " You know now that you can't control the factors that have a major impact on you because they are outside your active boundaries.

However, do you know? Within your active boundaries, there are a lot of things that you can control but you just gave up directly...but you never seriously thought about how terrible it is, merely because no one has pointed it out sharply to you. So you cannot care, as you don't know.

Let's look at an example, Batman.

Of course, there is no comic hero Batman in this photo - I want to show you the front-leading cyclist, who is known as Batman, whose name is [Daniel Kish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish). Daniel, born in 1966, after born in less than 13 months, he was blinded by eye cancer. Yes, this blind person is doing what you absolutely can't think about - he is riding a bicycle without any other auxiliary equipment... The other two are also blind, taught by Daniel! - Yes, this kind of magical skills cannot only be practiced but also taught!

Daniel explored a way to "see". He continually makes a sound from his mouth, and then perceives the world like a bat through sonar. He calls this method *Echolocation* ... and so people call him "Batman." There is [a speech](https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kish_how_i_use_sonar_to_navigate_the_world/transcript?language=zh-cn) from Daniel on TED. Let's take a look and see what it means to be an "eye-opener".

This Batman example will be used to further explain a particularly surprising topic:

> **Really active people are completely not believing in fate.**

Do you believe in fate? Do you dare say that you are not at all? There is a long distance between full faith and no faith at all. No matter which scale you stand on, it is not "total disbelief in faith."

![005](../images/005.png)

With just one second of self-examination, you will find that **it is really hard to completely not believe in fate**! It seems to be a matter of special courage, or why do you suddenly find yourself **hesitating**? And still **very hesitant!** Even, you can feel that there is a force in your heart that is against your choice - although you really want to choose not to believe at all, but you are hesitating; although you do not understand why, do not know what hesitating, anyway, hesitation is clearly there.

Don't sigh, nor feel self-conscious. This is not the feeling of you alone. This is basically a situation close to 100% probability. Whether is it 99% or still 99.99%? Anyway, on the other hand, 1% or 0.1% is a very small number. Few people do not believe in faith at all - very few of them, and most of them are nothing but ignorance and fearlessness...

And, this is also the fact:

> Over time, the majority of people will move from right to left – that is, more and more faithful.

Think about it, when you were very young, like almost all the children, you did not devoted to faith; but at that time, you didn’t know what the “faith” thing was. The people who are more and more faithful will eventually completely believe in faith in the end. Of course, in their self-explanation, it is not called "finally believe in faith", and it is called "**awakening**". If you really can't choose "not at all believing" here, then forget it. If you are hesitant, but still want to know what is going on, please be prepared before reading:

> **All truths have no obligation to take care of your emotions.**

Choose your own. This definitely takes courage and is still a lot of courage. What is courage? **Courage is the only virtue that cannot be forged.**

Ask a further question, please think carefully before answering:

> Does the past affect the future?

Go one step further, may I ask,

> Will the past definitely affect the future? If not, how much influence does the past affect the future? Is it a lot? Or is it not that big?

Still not finished, we need to ask till the end:

> If the extent of the past affecting the future is not that big, is it possible to simply cut off the link between the past and the future?

What is believing in faith? In fact, the matter of faithfulness has nothing to do with religion. It is not really related to superstition. It is completely caused by a loophole of logical thinking. The so-called superstition is just thinking with loopholes but not knowing where the loopholes are. The result is nothing more. You see, after the electricity was invented, the story about the demons and ghosts was not as good as it was before, wasn't it?

In essence, believing in faith is nothing more than to think that the past will inevitably affect the future. If you think that the past does **not necessarily** affect the future, then you will be suspicious of the matter of faith, think about it. Is this the case?

Now you can understand why I will think that "the **truly active people are completely not believing in faith** "? Because truly active people will find through simple and correct logical thinking, and sometimes we can even **completely cut off** the seemingly inevitable **connection** between the past and the future.

The most eloquent basis comes from the familiar probabilities. Have you heard of the gambler's fallacy? The gamblers don't know the concept of **independent events** in probability. They can't understand that the pros and cons of the next coin flip is an independent event, so all the previous results will not affect the next result at all - the next throw the probability of the front and back of the coin is still 1/2...

Never underestimate this simple scientific knowledge. This kind of thing has a huge impact on our lives - most people know and learn it, but rarely use it... As for it, there is no way to talk about it.

If you can understand the concept of an independent event, if you can understand how pitiful those who fall into the gambler's fallacy, then you can naturally understand another thing:

> Those who mistakenly believe that the past will inevitably affect the future are actually more pitiful. The gamblers in the casino, because they don’t understand the concept of independent events, fall into the gambler’s fallacy. What they lose is only his gambling at that time, and those who believe that the past will inevitably affect the future, directly lose all the future!

There is a good past (this probability is very low for most people); if it is not good in the past (this is a great probability event for everyone), and at the same time that the past will inevitably affect the future, then, what is the difference between the subsequent life and the living dead?

**The so-called total disbelief in faith is that a person makes up his mind and then tries his best to prevent his bad part in the past from affecting his future.**

Everything that is worth struggling in life is here, only here.

The above Batman Daniel is such a person. Through his own efforts, he made the past event of "losing his eyes", to the greatest extent, relative to other blind people, not affecting his present and future...

In real life, I also know another person like this, a Chinese, a woman - Liao Zhi. More than a decade ago, when she was in the Wenchuan earthquake, she lost her daughter and lost her legs when she escaped from earthquake. Her career is a dancer! A few years later, during the Ya’an earthquake, a reporter accidentally photographed a girl who was desperately trying to save people. She was surprised to find that the two legs of the girl who was struggling to save lives were prostheses... Liao Zhi is the rare one capable of cutting off the connection between the past and the future that seems to be inevitable. Later, Liao Zhi took the initiative to end her unhappy marriage life. A few years later, she met a Taiwanese from the United States who specialized in prosthetic limbs. You guessed what Liao Zhi said to the big boy that she later married and lives with?

> Can you make me grow up to two centimeters? That's perfect - I didn't have such an opportunity before!

If you are completely committed to faith, you don't have to make any investment, because your past, which is generally not good for ordinary people, will definitely determine your future. We have seen before, through the fixed vote mode, you not only do not let the past affect your future, even because you actually panned your entry time forward, you are like sitting in the time machine and going back to the past to fix it. Your past and then return to the future again.

This is why I have repeatedly said a key point before, now and in the future:

> **The key to the success of a Regular Investment strategy lies in psychological construction.**

Where does mental construction start? Start with never giving up. Don't let the unpleasant parts of your past affect your future, and cut off the connection between them - as for the good past, let it continue to work. Struggling in this place, this is the most valuable struggle, the root of all future good. Then begin to gradually explore and confirm the active boundary, then look for trends outside the active boundary and experience the passive power...

The Regular Investment strategy looks very simple, nothing more than **a certain amount of investment in a certain investment period for a long time.**

However, after in-depth thinking, in-depth research, and even exploring without feeling, we will understand that the magic of the Regular Investment strategy is actually very delicate. It is not just to make you a disciplinary people with opportunities and motivated people by locking in long-term holdings, and it also forces you to find the best investment target for long-term ups and not downs, but it also secretly does a lot of things:

> - It provides you with a unique environment that can be used to deeply understand the passive powers beyond the active boundaries;
> - It uses the irrefutable actual results to show you the connection between the past and the future is definitely not inevitable;
> - It gives you an opportunity to take yourself seriously to be the ultimate in the active boundaries...

Even, you may not think of it, it will eventually turn you into a relatively rare clean person - you just have to complete the plan quietly, either fail or gain great wealth. If you succeed, then you are harvesting **absolutely clean wealth**... Ask, is there a cleaner way to make money than this? With this way, what are your willingness and motivation to do other messy things?
