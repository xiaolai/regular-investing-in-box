## 9. The profound mechanism behind the magical power of the Regular Investment strategy

Let us start with a pair of concepts that seem to be opposite:

> **Active** and **Passive**

In general, active and passive are considered to be antonyms. “Active” is generally understood to be positive, while relatively “passive” is often understood as negative.

### 9.1. Develop your own active personality

In many cases, a person is passive, not active, and it is really not a good thing. Furthermore, you **must be proactive in cultivating an active personality that protects you.**

I often give an example. In any job, you can easily tell whether a person is active or passive. Active people work for themselves, passive people work for the boss - although they all receive the boss's salary exactly the same. If the active person leaves the office, they will turn off the air-conditioner and turn off the lights, just like leaving their home. Passive people can clearly distinguish between "what is what they should do" and "what is not related to me." "So, even though I really walked out of my home for a couple of kilometers, I would fold back and turn off the lights. But if I left the office last time, they only remember to close the door, even if the door was not locked, they could not feel it." Active people don't fool themselves. They know that they should be worthy of their energy and time spent. Passive people fool people with each other and fool themselves. They want to get away from responsibility everywhere, and they want to pay the smallest efforts in all areas. They want to pay the minimum cost, otherwise it feels unfair!

Look closely, **all the independent thinkers are active**, they will spontaneously study the problem; of course, they will spontaneously discover the problem, and finally spontaneously verify their thinking results, and whether the results are correct or not, they always apply and practice spontaneously. If something goes wrong, they will spontaneously come back again, adjust, correct, and demonstrate again through application... This is a complete closed-loop process system, and independent thinkers have long been accustomed to this active approach. So, at any time, when calling this process, it seems so natural that their external performance looks no different from other passive people.

All poor learning ability, poor hands-on ability, poor ability to think independently, lack of analytical ability, and impaired mobility are the result of passive personality. Although over time, they will find it harder and harder to get away with it, but they can't do anything about it. After spending so much money on so many years of study, they have not taken the initiative to self-learn any practical and effective skills in the society - such as search-based reading, such as creative writing, such as presentation, such as planning, such as leadership, such as making money, let alone investing!

What can a passive person with these attributes do in a situation where more and more places cannot be circumvented? You guessed it: **complain** .

**Stay away from those who complain all day** – they don't know what they are doing. They will be angry and filled with anger and complain of unfairness, as if Heaven is standing on his side. They never want to know the truth: the world is unfair. To describe it in a more accurate, unbiased, and unobtrusive vocabulary, which is that the world is full of **asymmetry**; just as the world is full of **uncertainty** .

The same is the responsibility: the responsibility of the boss and the responsibility of the staff are symmetrical? For a duty, is the obligation of the parents and the obligations of the teacher symmetrical? The same is the rush to work: is the rush of the designer's work and that of sales symmetry? For a risk, are the risks of vested interests and the risks of non-vested interests symmetrical? The same is happiness: is the happiness of men and the happiness of women symmetrical? It is very illogical and unreasonable to talk about the literal fairness without considering the objective existence of this asymmetry. But they don't know that they are based on ignorance, so they will be able to feel the anger and pain based on superficiality.

**In most cases, it is basically correct to choose to be an active person.** Choose to complete the task on your own initiative, choose to actively change the direction, choose to actively summarize the experience, choose to take the initiative to take responsibility, choose to actively learn and progress... If you are such a person, it is impossible to be excluded anywhere! Don't believe in the urban legend that says that ability is nothing and relationship is everything... If you are really unfortunately you are in such a place, leave it! Resolutely not leaving but complaining there is obviously a poor character! It is definitely a poor character when you complain about unfairness when you cannot take any advantages.

I was born in 1972, and the whole process of my growth is a process of undergoing social changes. In our time, many young people eventually became a variety of "angry youth." Fortunately, I was very young and reckless, but I was not "out of anger", so there is no way for me to be an "angry youth." Some people have lived a different life by their parents. Many people are dissatisfied. Excuse me, if you fight your peers through struggle, will you ignore your children? Is society unfair? Excuse me, which society is fair? Some unfair events have occurred. It is good to talk about things. If you haven’t learned the statistical probability, not just involve the case to the whole society. It’s true that unfair events have taken place, and that’s going to **fight for fairness** . Fairness is never something that you fall down in the sky. If you get fair, just as you gain dignity, you have to fight for it yourself. Right?

In January 2018, the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the Domestic Transportation Rules for Baggage of Civil Aviation stipulated that the elderly over 70 years old must take the aircraft with the certificate issued by the hospital at or above the county level. When the news came out, many people complained and even went out of anger. Among the most complained people, there is one person, my mother. My mother was born in 1945, just over 70... You can imagine how fierce the anger is when people are restricted. Anyway, she burst more than the angry youth I saw years ago!

We arranged the itinerary by phone. I spent more than ten minutes telling her a simple arithmetic: the accident rate, in which the word "rate" in the word is not alone, but the number of accidents is equal to the specific number multiplied by the accident rate. China's population base is so large; even if the same accident rate of one in ten thousand, in countries such as Ireland, Singapore, and Australia, the number of accidents that have occurred in several years may not be more than the number of accidents in China in a month. This kind of regulation is not for you alone, so there is nothing unfair, isn't it? The real unfairness is that in the face of this kind of regulation, I can arrange a station wagon to arrange the drivers for the shifts. Anyway, I can let you go wherever you want, but is it really unfair for those who do not have such conditions?!

This is the case with people. When the brain is congested, all the obvious answers, explanations, outlets, solutions, etc. seem to be “missing”, or even if they are clearly placed in front of them, they will “turn a blind eye”. After several rounds, my mother finally understood and said, hey, I really shouldn't be angry! I have a good son. Who is better than this? Then, we complimented each other for a while, and I also said that you are the one who gave me birth! So,we both were happy.

Those who complain all day should be defamed. If you kindly tell them lessons, they say that it is chicken soup; if you kindly show them a demonstration, they say that it is a performance. Then they go out to do things themselves. After several years, they turn back and say that these years are not good... In fact? In the past 40 years, China’s economic growth has been leading the world. Where is the bad environment? Anyway, no matter who it is, it cannot be denied that on the whole, China’s economic growth has been in the best state in history for a long time. Zhao Benshan has a section of a crosstalk that is absolutely correct:

> **If you don't have the ability, you have to say that you have no ability. How come wherever you go, the environment is bad? Then you must be the person who destroys the big environment!**

Anyway, holding the unfairness of others to cover one's own incompetence is really lame.
