## 13. The most important good news: for ordinary people, long term is not forever.

When an ordinary person listens to Buffett and says, "My **long-term is forever**", no matter who is on the side of the mirrored world, this person more or less will feel a little despair. Although no matter which side of the ordinary people are the same, the slightest despair is definitely not from doubts about what Buffett said. That desperation comes from the pity or pain that almost everyone has to face before:

> How do I know? ! (Or, if I knew it early, it would be great!)

In particular, when we think that when Buffett was 11 years old, he bought his first stock in life, and at an early age he had the opportunity to ask Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing... Compared with others, it’s our nature- human instinct, and once this instinct starts, the desperation will be overwhelmed, and everyone feels hopeless!

But this is not the case - it is definitely a super-liberal conclusion, but I need to slowly demonstrate it for you.

This one will definitely make many ordinary people feel gratified:

> **Every generation earns more money than the previous generation earned.**

And, more than a little more, but the difference in magnitude. This is not caused by inflation that many people joked. The reason for this phenomenon is simple and clear, because human society is developing, science and technology are advancing, and the scale of the economy is rising... This is the dividend of the times, and the dividends of this era are theoretically inclusive, which is in each generation everyone in the world should have access, or at least have the opportunity to receive the dividend of this era.

To put it simply, when Buffett was 11 years old, there was no Apple in his world that could reach the trillion level. Apple's market capitalization has soaring through trillions to become a spectacular milestone in the history of human economy. Prior to this, there was never a consumer product design and production company that was able to sell its products to such a high level that it lasted for a long time. On the macro level, this is the result of the continuous development of business in human society and the rising economic scale.

Each generation has its own understanding ceiling. Buffett struggled for so long before he bought Apple's stock, which is basically his ability limit - not to mention bitcoin, blockchain; to Buffett's theoretical system and cognitive limits, even Google (Google), Netflix, and Amazon can't be grasped. In theory, each generation has the limits of this particular generation, including the current younger generation. Over time, their exploration of their own active boundaries will come to an end, not because they don’t want to progress, but because of another motivation that is supported by economic theory: it is enough, even if it is no longer progressing! Of course, therefore, more boundary exploration will inevitably be done by the next generation.

However, there is another basis for more common reasons than the above reasons:

> **The duration of the economic cycle is gradually shortening.**

Human development, including the development of the economy, why can't it gradually rise steadily, why does it always have to jump up and down? Can it be as stable as I am?

Where does this fluctuation come from? Perhaps you have heard a noun, referred to as "Kangbo", the full name I can never remember, so I have to go through Google to copy Wikipedia and then get back and paste as the reference: " **Kondratyev long wave**." This "Master Kondratyev" is the first Russian to study the big cycle. The so-called Kangbo is a cyclical economic cycle phenomenon of about five or six decades. Generally, this long wave is divided into two phases, a rising phase A and a falling phase B.

The above picture explains the brief situation of the world economic trends under the long wave theory framework.

Although the guiding significance of this Kangbo theory in practical applications is always unclear and difficult to be quantified by the academics, and it is not too much valued by the academic community. Now Kangbo theory is only the theoretical cornerstone of many unorthodox economics.

However, this does not affect the simple facts we understand from it:

> - A rise is not a trend, and a decline is not a trend neither.
> - A rise plus a fall constitutes a cycle.
> - It takes at least two cycles to judge the trend...

After two cycles, the two fluctuations can only be one of three trends: rising, horizontal, or falling.

And when we look at the global stock market index price trend over the past four decades, we are seeing the overall upward trend of the cycle of many rises and falls.

![sp500from1979.tb](../images/sp500from1979.tb.png)

If we look at the price trend of Bitcoin, or the price trend of the total market capitalization of blockchain digital assets, it is the same, and it is the upward trend of the cycle formed by many rises and falls.

Then, why did the Great Depression of the 1930s recover in such a long time (that is, a cycle is completed), and the repair of the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s took only a few years? Furthermore, in this century, why is the global economic recession triggered by the US subprime mortgage crisis had been repaired faster?

The reason is very simple and straightforward, as anyone can understand:

> The high-speed flow of information makes global collaboration more coherent and easier, so although the crisis will continue to occur, the speed of repair is getting faster and faster.

To put it another way, **the formation of the economic cycle is essentially caused by sometimes coordinated and sometimes uncoordinated by multi-party collaboration.** - this multi-party referring to so many nodes that there is no way to know the existence of other nodes - when the communication efficiency becomes higher and higher, the duration of the cycle will change accordingly. It is getting shorter and shorter, although fluctuations—that is, occasional disharmony between multiple parties—may never be eliminated.

This is also the main reason why the fluctuation cycle of digital assets in blockchain is relatively short. In the past eight years, I have always heard that many people use Bitcoin to halve the amount of mining, that is, four years, as the basis for the judgment of the cycle. Perhaps at the earliest time, there was still a little bit of truth. This judgment is gradually losing its meaning when the market value of Bitcoin is no longer the total market value of blockchain digital assets.

I believe that the volatility cycle of blockchain digital assets is generally shorter than the stock market cycle, and the core reason for the shorter and shorter future is that the multi-party coordination efficiency of the blockchain trading market is obviously higher. From a point of view, you can understand that there are only a few influential stock markets on the planet, and what about the blockchain trading market? You can see it at coinmarketcap. Thousand are continuously operating 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Do you say that market coordination efficiency is far beyond the traditional stock exchange market?

The cycle is shrinking. What is the meaning of this simple and reliable conclusion for ordinary people? Simply put is:

> **The so-called "forever" is shortening.**

If the "forever" has been shortened, will it be too long in the long run?

What is long-term? In my opinion, for ordinary people, the so-called long-term is just " strong0}at least two major cycles" - this is the long-term; if you can spend three cycles, basically equivalent to Buffett's forever... ... How long is the two cycles? The current market value fluctuation cycle of blockchain digital assets is about three to five years. Therefore, in about seven years, there is a high probability that it has already passed two cycles. Please note that the focus is on **two major cycles**, not seven years.

How to judge the cycle? Quite simply, you look for the highest point in history, think of it as the starting point of the B phase of the current cycle (ie, the down phase), to the next highest point of history, and then fall from there, that is the B stage. After that, the A phase (ie, the rising phase) has already been completed, and the next cycle is entered...

It should be noted that such a large cycle, for anyone, only the starting point of the B phase is known, because that is the highest point of history before the current known. As for when the B phase ends? The A phase is opened at the same time as the end of the B phase, and when does the A phase end? You have no choice but to judge it now. It is useless to judge, because it is only a cycle. However, when two cycles have passed, you can't help but know that two cycles have passed, aren't you?

At that time, whether you want to continue to hold, or want to cash out, or cash out a part, continue to hold a part,  is totally up to you - now you may not imagine what the future will look like, but I can use my experience to tell you that your biggest change is exactly the same as everyone who really does it:

> **You will be as calm and serene as never before.**

You are an ordinary person, and how long is your long-term? I have already told you, as the answer is very simple, two big cycles or more. This is why we finally choose the blockchain digital assets as an ordinary person, and choose the reason why [BOX](https://b.watch) is scheduled to fixed invest, because in here, the two cycles are really short – especially in the near future, after you actually spend two cycles and look back, you will fully understand what I said.

Don't worry, because the so-called long-term is actually not long.
