## 9. The profound mechanism behind the magical power of the Regular Invesment strategy

Let us start with a pair of concepts that seem to be opposite:

> **Active** and **Passive**

In general, active and passive are considered to be antonyms. “Active” is generally understood to be positive, while relatively “passive” is often understood as negative.

### 9.6 How powerful is the passive force of following the trend?

Let me give an example from the opposite side. The **education** we usually talk about is an excellent example of being able to demonstrate passive negative forces.

Generations of people who are complaining about the failure of education - they are not only complaining about their failure in education, but also complaining about the failure of education in society as a whole. Not only in China, but also in the world, they are rethinking their so-called education again and again. — But if you are willing to change the angle, you will find the opposite explanation:

> In fact, in any era, in any country, education has always been exceptionally successful!

Why is there such a conclusion? Because we changed the angle to define education:

> **The so-called education, in essence, is what the system in which an individual is located wants to make him or her look like...**

Everyone is in a series of interlocking systems, our circle, our culture, our society, our country, our world... These are “already mature systems”. Don't be fooled into thinking that they are only objectively existing. In fact, way more beyond, these systems are actually living, and even having souls. They have the power and means of gods.

You see, in any system, there are people with vested interests and non-vested interests; the former is very few, while the latter is the vast majority. As a result, the goal of education is clear, and the people with vested interests will use it to make it more beneficial to themselves - without further explanation, you know what they will do! Non-vested interests will soon find that the unevenness of power is in the process of confrontation, so the overwhelming majority will turn to serve the vested interests; the few non-vested interests who still resist will eventually be eliminated; If the resistance of non-vested interests is successful, then they will instantly become vested interests and open the next "new" system that is also serving vested interests... This is an indiscriminate fact, so it is completely unnecessary to complain, because it is the same everywhere on the planet. Isn't that the case?

Therefore, the so-called education is only defined as follows:

> **Education is what the system you are in is trying to make you look like...**

If education is so defined, and if the status quo is indeed the case, then the conclusion is obvious: all education in history has been quite successful, and can even be called exceptional success... and it has always been more and more successful. From this point of view, the failure of education that people complain about is, in essence, nothing more than the discomfort of the people with non-vested interests in the system.

Do ordinary people have a way out? Still there is.

If education is defined as such, how should **self-study** be defined?

> **If education is what this system wants you to become, then, in contrast, self-study is what you want to be.**

Therefore, the more accurate wording may be two relative terms:

> - Be educated
> - Self educated

The vast majority of people feel extremely uncomfortable in the process of being educated (ie, the process of assimilation by the system) – this is natural. However, the next choice is the strongest to reflect the struggling: the vast majority of people give up being educated, and **only a very small number of people choose self-education.** Self-educated people are self teaching not only from time to time, but also for the whole life. What is striking is that after carefully observing history, you will find that **people who change the world are self-educated without exception.**

On the other hand, whether they are educated or abandoned being educated, they are ultimately assimilated by the system - passive forces have exerted a very powerful influence on them, so powerful that they are helpless and ultimately thought it was the power from the ghosts.

There is a TV series called "Year after Year", produced in 1999. I suggest you take the time to watch. The story begins in 1978 and each episode speaks a whole year, for a total of 21 episodes. A role in the story is the cinema projection staff, so each episode mentions a movie of the specific year. In addition, each episode has a song of the year. More importantly, each episode reminds you of one of the most important events of the year... The story is not particularly good, but it can make you I really feel how small each individual is in a system and how powerful the factors you can only passively face.

The strength of the negative forces that we can only passively face, at the same time, is equal to their positive power. Let's take a look at an example of the passive positive forces associated with us that play a huge positive role.

In the field of fund management, funds are divided into two types, **active funds** and **passive funds** .

![Funds_flows_into_active_and_passive_funds.tb](../images/Funds_flows_into_active_and_passive_funds.tb.png)

The above chart shows the capital inflows of active and passive funds worldwide over the past several years. Why do capital increasingly favor passive funds? Why are active funds increasingly being rejected? It is because capital is more and more aware of the power of passiveness.

Active funds require a one-time manager who analyzes the market and then picks out a portfolio that can outperform the market. Based on the expectations of these managers, investors need to pay a very high management fee and share, and also bear the transaction costs of frequent trading of these managers. In contrast, passive funds do not advertise their analytical skills, do not actively do frequent operations, but passively follow a representative index (such as S&P 500)...

For many years, questions about fund managers have never been rare. Some people even joke that you throw stocks into a house, put a monkey in, and after a while, pick out the stocks of the monkeys that have been urinated to form a portfolio, and the final result can also outweigh those active funds. Fund manager...

Is that true? Or is it really just a joke? What you need to understand is that the history of the modern securities trading market has not grown long. The truly modern trading market did not appear until the 1970s. People have only four phenomena in the trading market. About fifty years of data is available for effective research.

According to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/indexes-beat-stock-pickers-even-over-15-years-1492039859) (April 13, 2017), as of December 31, 2016, a total of 95.4% of medium-sized funds were behind S&P MidCap 400 and 93.2% of small funds were behind by 15-year performance. At S&P SmallCap 600, 92.2% of large funds lag behind S&P 500...

The fans of the active fund have a seemingly reasonable objection. They believe that as more and more money flows into passive funds, it will eventually turn the strategy into a “following flow”, which will make active fund management relatively more advantageous. However, long-term investors actually understand that short-term changes in the market or a new trend will give active fund managers a short-term advantage. However, from the 15-year-based statistics, long-term investors can ignore them. ......

The most interesting part is the conclusion:

> - **The longer the investment cycle**, the greater the passive advantage;
> - The **greater the investment amount,** the greater the passive advantage...

My personal past experience has confirmed this to myself.

In 2013, I began to manage an early fund that was particularly small and invested in Bitcoin-related projects. By 2018, that is, a four-year management period, plus a one-year liquidation period, after a total of five years, the market value of the fund has become about 68 times the starting amount... Although it looks very amazing, it actually makes people quite discouraged - because this score did not outperform Bitcoin's gains. In other words, if all the funds were used to buy Bitcoin at the time, and I did nothing in the next 5 years, then it would be 58 times. You can see that the final result will not be much worse than the current one. Of course,I make profit by doing a fund, and after 30% of the starting profit, the return of the investor has become about 48 times, slightly lower than the growth of Bitcoin itself.

What is even more discouraging is another factor. In the past five years, it was breath-taking and heart-stirting for managing this fund – a few times almost plummeted to the bottom, and then made a comeback by luck... In the process, it is normal, in fact, if this fund is really lost; especially, the blockchain world is a place where the amplitude of fluctuations is many times larger than the stock market.

Not losing is a happy accident. It’s actually a surprise in the accident. Therefore, when the bit fund was finally liquidated, I felt that I could only be a passive fund in the next step. There was no other choice at all. After more than a year of thinking, I finally designed the [BOX](https://b.watch), an open source blockchain ETF fund product. The current booklet is actually a reflection of the process of creating my ideal passive fund model.

Let us focus on the key point of this section first.

Let us think: the same conclusion, when is mapped to the individual, cannot be applied directly every time:

> - **For those more ambitions, the more passive forces are needed;**
> - **For those with more energy, the more passive power is needed...**

Passive power is not only great, but **it is always harder to surpass** .

Once passive forces are triggered, they are unbeatably powerful. However, **being active will trigger passive positive forces, and passives will trigger passive negative forces.** Therefore, it is said that only actively passive is the optimal strategy.

In addition, with regard to following the flow or trend, you may have new insights:

> - Looking at the short-term results with the big flow is definitely wrong;
> - Aiming at long-term results is perhaps the only right choice when following the big flow...

You see, even if everyone thinks that they understand a word, "follow the big flow", after a little serious thinking, they will get different, even may form diametrically opposite conclusions.
