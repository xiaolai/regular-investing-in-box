## 10. In the mirror world, how can you always choose the right one as an ordinary person?

Sometimes, there is indeed a moment of "decisive victory". When you enter the trading market and choose the **Regular Investment strategy**, you have actually won it completely, and it is still very simple to win - then on all the nodes, you are in the **mirror world**. It's that simple. When you decide to teach yourself, as soon as you start to **pay attention to all the clichés** , you win directly and win very simply - on all the nodes that follow, you are in the correct one in the mirror world (see " [Self-study is a Craft](https://github.com/selfteaching/the-craft-of-selfteaching)).

For many years in the past, I have often had a confusion. Why are so many useful truths, in fact, in the eyes of most people is another look? The concept of **mirror world** can be used to explain this strange and helpless phenomenon, but it does not directly provide a solution that is truly simple and rude and directly effective. Until one day, in the trading market, in the investment field, after witnessing the magic of the Regular Investing strategy, I finally understood a very simple solution:

> **People without great goals always choose the wrong one in the mirror world.**

My personal good luck is because, many years ago, it was impossible to understand the situation as clearly as I am now. But this has actually completed the first step, and the benefits of this concept will only be realized after many years.

There are some reasons, even if it is in front of you, there is not much support for it. It is incomprehensible, incompletely understandable, and it may even simply by refused to accept by a blind eye. At the end of 2018, Arnold Schwarzenegger had a famous speech, "The True Truth of Success."

In the video, he said, the reason why I stand here today is:

> I have a **goal**.

I don't know if it is intentional or not. He used a more plain word than "Dream" and "Ideal", " **Goal**". For this goal, he can only work (work his butt off). I have watched this video many times, every time I feel different - and it is because of this video that I found out that I can explain my thoughts through this example and prove it to everyone: there are great goals and ordinary goals. The goal is to put you in the opposite side of the mirror world.

I shared an experience of my childhood in my book "Treat Time as a Friend". Once the teacher left homework, proposition composition, "My Ideals." I didn't hand in my homework the next day. Why? I did't have ideals, so I can't write it... When I tell the teacher the truth, I was considered by the teacher to be a disobedient child, who caused chaos in the classroom. So, the teacher made a big move: Go! Bring your parents! I have never seen a kid like this!

Of course, my father was on call as other parents. When he arrived at the office, he just stood there quietly listening to the teacher's big noise, saying nothing, just taking out the cigarette and silently taking one. The office was completely quiet, and my father opened his mouth: "Mr. Chen, I want to hear, what is your ideal?" He ordered another cigarette until he was finished and no one spoke. Then he turned and pulled my hand and said, "Go home."

So, you can imagine that for many years after that, I refused to think about the concept of **ideals** . Therefore, I have long thought that I am a person who really has no ideals. Of course, today as I look back, I feel that I am not really without any ideal, but naturally reject the kind of flashy concept.

Once again, my luck is good enough. Although I was almost misguided by the idea that I think the flashy concept is ideal, I have unknowingly learned another method that is actually simpler and more rude and easy to use:

> **Give great meaning to what you want to do and what you are doing.**

Many years ago, I accidentally read an article about a writer I liked, Bi Shumin, at a university lecture. A student asked a "ultimate question":

> Teacher Bi, what is the meaning of life?

Ms. Bi Shumin’s answer is:

> **Life is meaningless, and meaning is what we are living out?** (to the effect)

Ms. Bi Shumin would never know that in a corner of the earth where she could not understand, her words were indelibly engraved in the mind of a young man.

**I found this trick very powerful! As long as you give a very great meaning to one of your actions, you seem to suddenly change your personality** - because when you do that, you don't have to insist, you don't need to be encouraged, you simply not afraid of setbacks, you don't care that others don't agree with not supporting, even if someone stops you from letting you do that, you will completely face him - a powerful self-driving force.

Do you know why I like to write articles, write books, and lectures? Because this kind of behavior has great meaning!

In the distant past, the awesome teachers will fall into the trap of self-righteousness. At that time, it was not only difficult for people to find a good master. What is even more frightening is that it was very difficult for a good master to find a good apprentice. Therefore, when a good master recruits an apprentice, he is very careful! However, the so-called good promising students that teachers have tried hard to recruit or screen out have proved to be mediocre goods many years later, which proves that the original self-righteousness is very ridiculous and helpless... Of course, you can describe this phenomenon now: this is of course because they have to rely too much on the initiative outside the active boundary - teaching good is within the active boundaries, and the growth of students, in most cases, is outside the teacher's active boundaries.

Do you know how great is the meaning in the world today, when people are writing articles, writing books, and teaching on the Internet?

You think about seeing Ms. Bi Shumin inadvertently changed a young man far away from the border town many years ago - she knows? she does not know. Is it important to her? In fact, it is very important, because her knowledge, her cognition, after the spread, in the young man named Li Xiaolai, " **Big Love** " is reflected - the indifferent love is the real love! Regardless of whether Ms. Bi Shumin knows (and certainly does not know), whether she is deliberate (and certainly not intentional), whether she cares (not sure), only because of the indiscriminate communication, that knowledge and that recognition trigger the effect of big love!

This is the maximum that a wise and wise man can do to “get rid of self-righteousness”! Therefore, open source of good things is such a meaning, letting the good things complete the effect of no difference big love - in my opinion, this meaning is extremely great, indispensable great! So, you can imagine, if you are me, when whoever would dare to stop you and not let you do such a great thing, you will be completely anxious with this person, isn't it?

Many years later, Li Xiaolai became a person who did not lack money. When he was young, he bragged that he retired at the age of forty! At the age of forty-three, I really had the conditions to retire - of course, afterwards, I found that retirement is essentially self-destructive... Since I can't and don't want to be self-abandoned, what should I do? Continue to do what I like to do! What do I like to do? Definitely what I can do things with the greatest meaning! What is it for me? Write books and give lectures. Many people don't understand, and question, "you have earned so much money, how can you still write a book to lecture"? The saboteurs are more funny. They think that "the fact that Li Xiaolai is still writing a book" can prove that Li Xiaolai is still very short of money... Years of experience have made me understand that for people who mirror the other end, even if I try to explain, what they hear is still the opposite - so I don’t have to work hard to explain, and I should be doing what I like best. **What is the significance of making a lot of money? Isn't it just to ensure that you don't be bothered by the outside world when you do what you like to do?**

So, you don't have to use the big word "ideal"  (as I was almost misled by its gorgeous appearance when I was young, then I don't like this word and think it's flashy), but you can use my simple method that I accidentally learned and have practiced for many years, which is necessarily effective:

> **Give great meaning to what you are doing.**

If you look back, you will understand why, in the beginning, you will be told that "investment is the only reliable way for ordinary people to get rid of class solidification". This is what I am giving you a great meaning for what you have to do and what you have to do. Of course, you can also find your own meaning that is very great for you.

Not only that, but I will explain it to you from various angles. What is its principle, what is its role, and what is its significance? More importantly, no matter from which angle, it can be proved that the Regular Investment is definitely what all ordinary people should do. More importantly, the Regular Investment is definitely something that all ordinary people can do. It is very realistic, not exaggerated, and powerful. And you don't have to make blindly and disorderly conjecture about it.

It is not excessive for repeating many times:

> For all ordinary people, the **Regular Investment strategy** is absolutely feasible, no exaggeration, and it is up to you. The **ordinary people** mentioned here, are regardless of national boundaries, regardless of region, regardless of race, regardless of gender, regardless of age, regardless of height, weight, thinness, beauty, ugliness, regardless of sexual orientation... The key is that even IQ and education do not matter!

Anyway, now I feel that it **is good to be a person with ideal.**
