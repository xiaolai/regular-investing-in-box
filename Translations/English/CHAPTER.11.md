## 11. Since you are an ideal person, you should never be a dabbler.

After entering the trading market, you will encounter all kinds of people  - of course, most of them are not your kind, and you are among the very small one. Soon, you will find that the vast majority of people you meet are dabblers. Of course, you already know, and those bubbling the decentralization are definitely dabblers. It’s definitely a dabbler who talk about the consensus. It is also a dabbler who said that he or she has a lot of investment experience but never thought about how to dilute the opportunity cost. ...

Give you another example of a dabbler.

Do you often listen to someone who is showing off, "when I am going to bottom out!" The people who say this are all stupid, really stupid. why? Because, let's not say whether they are long-term investors, whether they are value investors, even if they are short-term operators. Even so, they are still stupid in that group. Then why?

You can understand it when you think about it. The shorter the operation, the more successful it will be, the more effective it is when there are successes repeatedly, right? It is necessary to continue to buy low and sell many times in order to really make money. The problem is that they can't do it. What is the difference between making a double defeat and a coin toss? Every day, they are throwing coins in the hands to determine the fate, but they are thinking that they are riding the wind and breaking the waves. These people have this illusion that others don't.

Therefore, it is only one of a series of actions to get rid of the bottom. He did have a bottom-up, but he did not succeed in escaping, so he fell below. Then does he still lose money? He ran off, but then he didn't buy it at the bottom, and then he watched the target hit a new high. Didn't he still lose it? Therefore, if the bottom-selling is successful, then it will be successful in escaping the top; or conversely, after the success of the escaping, there will be a successful bottom-up, which is called real success.

**Don't you say that such a person, who is holding half of the operation to brag to the whole world, must be a common big fool?**

Moreover, in general, the "successful bottom-up", "successful escape" are all bragging. Because the person who holds half of the whole force will soon be beaten by the other half, and the probability is almost 100%. If you don't believe it, you try it carefully. Even, you don't want to observe others, you just have to observe yourself before the start of the Regular Investing.

In real life, this kind of person is called "dabbler." **The fate of the dabblers is very normal, which is very normal** misery - isn't the life of normal people very bad? Because most of the so-called normal people are actually dabblers.

There are so many different kinds of dabblers!

It won't take long for you to know and even participate in futures contract trading. However, there you will encounter a larger proportion of dabblers. Futures contract trading is theoretically an aid to spot trading.

For example, I now need to sell 100 bitcoins for some reason. The problem is that I am a long-term investor. In my opinion, bitcoin is long-term bullish, but I have to sell 100 bitcoins... In real life, many miners often face such embarrassing situations. Usually, when they sell, the price of the currency begins to skyrocket... The most irritating iron law is that once they need legal currency (such as the Renminbi or the US dollar), the bitcoin price plunges – as if it is always.

So what should they do? They should be like this,

> 1. Sell 100 bitcoins in the spot market;
> 2. Then buy a 10x leveraged bullish contract in the contract market with, for example, 10 bitcoins.

In this case,

> - If the price of bitcoin rises afterwards, then he will certainly not lose, because the 10 times leveraged contract will definitely make him make up for the "less earned" money;
> - If the price of bitcoin falls afterwards, then the 100 bitcoins sold in the spot market are worth the money, and the loss of a lot of money, so the 10 bitcoins are worth the loss...

Why do you say that 99% of contract traders are dabblers? Because they do not do a full set of work, as  in the case of not doing spot trading, they directly only do futures contract transactions ... This has no hedging effect and then becomes 100% gambling.

So, when you heard that they broke the position again, you still don't understand why? Isn't the normal world supposed to be like this? Isn’t the normal dabblers supposed to live a bit worse?

So, if you really need to trade in futures contracts, then at least you need to learn more. There is a simulation transaction on [btcmex.com](https://btcmex.com) . You are going to play around with "counterfeit currency". It takes a long time (such as at least three months) to carefully study every detail and make sure that you really understand it before you actually start the operation. When you need to trade in a futures contract, don't be a dabbler. Use a hedging strategy at the spot exchange (such as BigOne: [https://big.one](https://big.one) or [https://b1.run](https://b1.run) ) - the set of instructions above. The policy is also applicable in turn.

This is basically our attitude towards life:

> **Either don't do it, no matter what it is, as long as it is decided to do it, then do a full set of work.**

You can never do a dabbler--in particular, you are an ideal person, how can you fall to the point of dabbler!

Once you start to make up your mind not to do a dabbler, you are like being blinded, and it's always easier to find more dabblers - until one day you are intimidated by them and start to fear that you will become a dabbler. **Fear is also a good motivation.**

Often, you will meet someone who brags, saying how much you have bottomed out at the lowest point, or vice versa, saying how much you have evaded at the highest point... Dabblers' bragging is without drafts, as they think there is no necessary. In the market where the centralized bidding is combined, the price is not an independent existence. It must be combined with the single quantity of the market to truly count. Whoever talks the price separately is a dabbler.

Go and see the trading interface. At the lowest price or the highest price, what is the trading volume of the market? This is a fact that will never change: at the highest and lowest points, the trading volume of the market is always very small – because that is not the normal price, it is the “transient distortion price that will soon be quickly corrected by the entire market". At that price, you can't buy much at all, or you can't sell at all - beyond that amount, the price will continue to fall, or vice versa, so it is no longer the lowest or highest point. That's not the bottom-hunting or escaping of the dabblers' bragging... I don't quite understand what their purpose is to brag? What are they going to do next?

In addition, some of the dabblers will yell at you and say how many times the number of the target you have never heard of has risen in a short period of time... It is absolutely a dabbler to say this. How many times to rise is not a separate calculation, and it must be combined with other factors to see if it makes sense. What is the distribution of the target's flux? What is the trading volume of the target during this period? If a target, the market has a small amount of liquidity, the chips are not scattered enough, the trading volume is actually very small, and a hundred times increase is useless, because you can't profit from this skyrocketing 100 times - the trading volume is too small, so the amount of money you can get in and out is relatively small. You can only invest 1 yuan, and then skyrocket 100 times in a day. Is this too significant? And because the chips are not scattered enough, there are people who hold too many chips, then, once you invest more money, they will sell the chips directly to you who dare to pay such a high price - this is called "rationality".  This is the so-called "banker cuts the leeks"... Are you still willing to play?

Even if you are stupid, you are not foolish! After all, you are the person who read this book. After all, you have become a lot more civilized. After all, you have been enacted, aren't you? To be honest, those poor dabblers are not stupid. They are just ignorant, not educated, so they are not civilized and they are easily confused by various appearances - just as the primitive people can only be superstitious.

However, the poorest dabblers are not the people mentioned above. The most miserable dabblers I have seen these years is the kind of ** person who has made long-term decisions but has finally lost halfway**. There are many reasons for the halfway give-up. The people who have been halfway through are always on the other side of the mirror world, and they are comforted by words like "you have to adopt yourself to the dusty world as you come.

In the real world, every time you encounter such a person, you record them, then observe their horrors and observe their self-comfort... Especially observe that the longer they used to “stick”, the higher the price for them to drop halfway. Moreover, the greater the ideals at the beginning, the more miserable the next game is. It is so terrible that they must constantly rely on the story to deceive themselves to not commit suicide.

Are you afraid to see their actual situation? I do not know. When I seriously observed those people, I often felt creepy and even couldn't sleep because of them... But after many years, this kind of fear-based motivation has definitely played a huge role for me. I am genuine in nature. To tell the truth, it is absolutely that they have slowly honed me over the years. When I was a child, I was a person who loves bragging and special vernacular!

In addition, if you are willing to think deeply, you, the person who definitely doesn't want to be a dabbler, will reach another amazing conclusion:

> **The vast majority of funds on the market are definitely not worthy of Regular Investment!**

Where does this come from? You see, the core of Regular Investment is that there is only one choice for fixed investors, **long-term holding**. So, you have to repeatedly ask yourself, is this subject worthy of your long-term holding? You can see the vast majority of funds ask you to fixed invest, and then they do not use the same method, but take the money you have invested for their self-righteous active management - do not rule out there could be indeed extremely good managers, but in the end only 5% of the managers have proved to be extremely good – isn't that for the regular investors, is this passively a complete dabbler? ! After entrusting his original 100% successful strategy to others, he has a 5% success rate. Where is it worse than this?!

By the same token, you will react, why [BOX](https://b.watch) is the best Regular Investment product – because it does not make any discounts on the dominant strategy. **And it's done to the extreme, and there is no discount on the effect - its management fee is zero!**
