## 7. How do people magically avoid the highest quality investment targets?

Examples that have been repeatedly mentioned sometimes need to be examined from another perspective.

> In our view, Guizhou Moutai must be chosen. In our opinion, there must be Kweichow Moutai in the long run. What is the result? As a result, only less than five-thousandths of the shareholders hold Moutai, and the proportion of long-term holdings is estimated to be much less than this...

How do more than 99% of the investors watch, or so-called **magically** avoid, the **highest quality** investment targets? Even, without exaggeration, they can magically avoid **all the** best quality targets! This ratio can avoid Maotai, you can avoid Vanke, you can avoid Tencent, you can avoid Coca-Cola, you can avoid Bitcoin! It should be mentioned that Kweichow Moutai has risen 180 times in the past eight years; Bitcoin has risen 10,000 to 20,000 times in the past eight years...

The answer is that they are still ill: **a disease with a long-term gain.**

In fact, many people have actually bought the highest quality standards, or they have held it for a long time.

This is also a very common disease.

The symptoms are like this. They will say, "There ** have been so many rises, will it rise again?! What things in the world are constantly rising?!** " Then, he calmly handed over the chips.

If they give up the target that is indeed in a downward trend, then they may be right – but the problem is that the more probable situation you see in real life is the opposite. They are just kicked out by the price they think is already high – in fact, both high and low prices have a significant part of the shock.

Will the fixed investors be like this? Fixed investors will not. Still under the same principle, if you don't look good in the long run, why do you want to invest first? Because Regular Investing is not a one-time investment activity, it is an action that can be completed by subsequent long-term regular investment. Therefore, the temporary high price or low price in the short term will have no effect on the fixed investors. The most important feature of the fixed investors is what they should do...

As I said before, it is because I am counting on the long-term, and the next bet is my own future. Therefore, the speculators rely on a series of targets selected by the most intelligent people on the market – both investors and speculators. They also invest with their money, so all the quality targets have a common characteristic: the **market value is relatively large, the liquidity is relatively good, and the chips are relatively scattered** . The decision makers use this simple method to choose what seems to be reliable in the long run that is keeping rising, so when looking at the same price fluctuations, their reaction is the opposite: indifferent.

Another related illness is this. They will say, “Is **this target so expensive?** ” For example, Maotai stocks in the Chinese stock market, such as bitcoin that has been in circulation for ten years... Most people are just because of Maotai’s stock. The absolute value of the price or the price of Bitcoin looks very high, so they retire and use their ingenuity to find "the next ten times stock", "the next daily limit stock" or "the next hundred times the currency" - Most of them have not succeeded. why? Because investment is not about price, it is about growth potential. Many people mistakenly believe that the base is small and it is easier to grow. This is completely unfounded.

Fixed investors will still avoid this trap. Because **the only criterionfor a given voter is whether the subject is worth holding for a long time**. This standard is simple and straightforward, and it is difficult to make mistakes. Fixed investors will not retreat because the absolute value of the investment target price seems too high, because that is not the core that needs to be considered. How high is its absolute value? As long as it can grow in the long run, it should be fixed, long-term regular investment, of course, can only be held for a long time... This is why the fixed investors are still buying at the time of Apple’s 500 billion market value, at 600 billion When the market value is still being bought, it is still buying when it has 700 billion yuan and 800 billion market value... One trillion? They buy what they should buy. That's why fixed investors buy when the bitcoin price is $100, then buy it when it's $1,000, buy it when it's $10,000, and then buy it after falling to $4,000. Wouldn't it be like this?

Some people are not convinced, saying that is it never sold? Hey, this depends on the financial strength and mental strength of investors. On this point, Buffett’s words are worth pondering. He said that **my long-term is forever** . This sentence is usually interpreted superficially. What I personally learned in this sentence is that since you have to hold it forever, you can only be careful when you choose the target, do your best to study it, and then make a choice. Then, since you have chosen yourself, you have to be responsible for yourself and always be responsible for yourself.

Another small problem is that those who are wondering " **Don't you sell forever?** " don't have the chance to realize the fact that they are really rich, and they are afraid that they have no money to spend? Will you be afraid that you don't want to spend money? Too lazy to spend money obviously needs more fianacial strength ... Really achieved across the hierarchy, a person certainly will not have such doubts.

Another symptom is the “ **frequently changing lanes** ” mentioned earlier. This kind of person is like someone who keeps changing lanes when traffic jams on the road. He bought a target, but it will not be long before he finds that other targets have risen more than the target in his hands... Then he can’t help it, and he trades the line and sells the target in his hand. Enter another target. However, not long after, he will find that the new target has reached his hand, it has not risen as sharply as it turned out, and even began to fall... He may change back if he thinks he is unlucky, until he admits that he really does not suitable for doing this area.

The people who fixed invest will not do this. They will not compare the targets they have already identified with other ones, because they have already been compared. Otherwise, why do you choose the target for the investment? This is especially true for those who invest for [BOX](https://b.watch) . They have already chosen a lot of targets, and they clearly know that they have diluted the opportunity cost and clearly know that their investment targets have surpassed a single blockchain. The project, and then the bet is the development of the entire industry... What's more, since it is a Regular Investment, what is the look and feel of the moment? Even the noise doesn't count... It doesn't matter at all because it affects nothing.

Don't feel wordy and repeated of the above content:

> **All the repetitions are that Regular Investment is too simple and too amazing!**

I always believe that there are many very simple and rude means in the world that allow everyone to avoid all the pits. However, for a variety of reasons, most people always choose other complicated and indirect fancy means to waste their lives.

When I was teaching English, I found out that many people have wasted their time. Reading an hour every morning is better than anything else. One's English is not good, simply because this person does not speaks English much. There is no other reason to discern. I don't know what the reason is. I always don't get approval when I say this. In general, because many people think that they have encountered so many difficulties, how can you make it clear in one sentence? They don't know many difficulties they have encountered are the many pits they actually dig by themselves. Therefore, they spend money to sign up for the class, looking for all kinds of strange shortcuts called methods... In the end, they can only have transient peace for a while, and then continue to be tortured in the pit.

I also found the same problem when I was writing. The most important thing people do not do: improve the effective reading. This is very simple: if there is no input, where is the output! I have never seen it before, and I can't imagine that a person with a small amount of reading will write something that many people read and enjoy. This is not my own observation and conjecture! Mr. Mo Yan, the Nobel laureate in literature, said the same thing - " [Mo Yan eleven school speeches: reading is the best teacher of creation](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/d1zlEFpi7tIKIT5wVILL3w)." Many people either all day bother writing teacher to write all kinds of magical writing skills, or spend money to sign up for classes with striking heads and tricks... But they just ignore the most simple, straightforward, and effective thing: More reading less nonsense!

Another interesting phenomenon is the so-called health. In fact, the simplest and most rude way is to continue to exercise. From a scientific point of view, there can be no more effective way than this. However, people are not doing this! All kinds of various fallacies and heresies have the biggest market. Drink this, eat that, this is not good, that can't. But they resolutely do not exercise. They don't know what they want to do. Of course, the most funny thing is the diet drug market. There are hundreds of species in the world every year. In fact, thousands of new weight-loss products may be on the scene. History has proved to be ineffective, but it is the biggest piece of cake created in the consumer market. Why not exercise? They said that exercise is anti-humanity... Hey, idiots really think that their temperament is not a stupid temperament, but the humanity of all people. Can we say something about this kind of mistake?

**There is only one stroke in the cast.** A lot of people will mistakenly think that there is nothing remarkable about a one-shot move - it's too simple. Between simplicity and complexity, people tend to choose complexity, because complexity always gives people a higher level of thinking, or people think it is more advanced. However, please be aware that the maximum power of the **Regular Investment is precisely because it has only one stroke.** Because, the result of only one stroke is that there is absolutely no other choice for you to invest, and you just have to do it. You only have one action, and that's the only action - and that action will never go wrong.

Those who think they have a lot of styles? With pure logic analysis, you know where their disadvantages are.

For example, in the investment action, the fixed investor has only one action, that is, to buy. What about those people who are not fixed investment? Or what about non-fixed investors? The problem is that they want to buy at the good time of the purchase, and then "sell at the good time of the sale." The problem is that **"in the end** when to buy and when to sell it?" - they often do not actually know, but **think** they know it.

If they can do it right every time, they really buy it when they buy it, they really sell it when they sell it, and they can do it in a sequence – how good it is! Can it be? Unless they are like God every time, or basically, they always have a half probability of choosing to sell at the time of the purchase, and then there is always a half probability of choosing to buy at the time of the sale... As a result, they only reduced their success probability from 100% to 25% because of one more move!

Don't be argumentative: how do you feel that I can have half the probability of making mistakes every time? ! OK, even if you have a good grasp of 80% every time, then in fact you always have the right probability of only 80% x 80% = 64% success rate... much lower than 100%! What's more, if you really want to use your own money to keep trying to make mistakes, you will definitely get a conclusion that let alone 80% grasp, 60% is difficult to grasp! Even, 60% of the grasp is a relative master! If it is 60%, the probability of success for the second time is 36%. This explains why most investors will eventually feel that all their operations are wrong... In fact, if you can understand short-term price changes are completely **random walks** , so you can't predict them correctly, then you will understand that their success rate is 50% x 50% = 25% exactly.

What's even more frightening is that they not only have one more trick than one trick, but they have too many styles! For example, they not only keep buying and selling in the short term, but they also frequently change lanes between several targets... To ensure that lanes are replaced correctly every time, the probability is not much, they are repeated! Even if there is a probability of success of 80% each time, after four or five consecutive changes, the success rate will definitely fall below 40%...

So, what they feel is right, because the probability of mistakes is always higher.

And those investors who constantly research various technologies are even worse. They have more than two strokes. They have too many styles! If you just read this book, you will feel that you have realized it. If you listen to any master lecture, you will be able to do it. You can’t help but learn the new lessons. In other fields, this kind of eagerly search for and apply new ones. It is definitely a good habit, but it can be in the investment field. This habit will kill people. In fact, most ordinary investors are killed by themselves, because ordinary people do not have so much luxury to make so many trials and errors.

The core reason that most people can avoid all the magic of the highest quality investment targets is that, for various reasons, they resolutely refused to use only the safest and most reliable one and only one strategy - **Regular Investment.**
