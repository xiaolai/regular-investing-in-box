## 9. The profound mechanism behind the magical power of the Regular Investment strategy

Let us start with a pair of concepts that seem to be opposite:

> **Active** and **Passive**

In general, active and passive are considered to be antonyms. “Active” is generally understood to be positive, while relatively “passive” is often understood as negative.

### 9.2. Most active people don’t even know the boundaries

As you begin to care about your active personality, as you continue to shape and care for your active personality, you will feel that **there are too few active people.**

I have previously said an example. My good friend Huo Ju (now the CTO and COO of PressOne) is the one who taught me to socialize. Think about it, how can there be effective social interaction for me who like to stay at home! Years of non-social push me write the article that spreads widely on the Internet and has a cumulative reading of more than one billion: "Forget your ineffective socialization." However, Huo Ju changed me. While playing at his house, I saw that he spent an afternoon tabulating his business card, making a mark, muttering in his mouth: "Well, this person seems to have not been in contact for three months, I should visit him... ”

So I learned. In the blink of an eye, I have found that in fact most of the effective relationships require at least one of the parties to take the initiative, and if both are passive, then they might only slowly break the connection. You see, invalid social interactions really have to be put down, but how about effective social interaction? In order to get effective social interaction, you must turn yourself into a person who is active in this area.

Although the active energy is great for any individual, the **initiative is bounded**. Beyond that boundary, the initiative will lose its effect and even have a negative effect... Why most family education ends up being failed? Why is the proportion of failures so high, even so outrageous? Why can't the broad discussion in society solve this problem? There is a possible explanation for this cold fact:

> Parents always use the power of initiative in places where they should not take the initiative.

In other words, parents unwittingly took the “active boundary” without knowing it.

**The first boundary of the initiative is oneself** .

In its own right, everything should take a proactive attitude; however, beyond itself, beyond the active boundary, the initiative is more likely to have a negative effect. If parents are trying to turn themselves into better ones, then this is to apply "active" within the active boundaries.

It is a pity that the most common words spoken by most parents or the most frequently flashed thoughts are: "Our generation has already been like this...", then they began to hope that the next generation is different from their own, so they Apply everything that they can take on outside of themselves, which is, outside their active boundaries - their children.

What they never expected was that the result of their work was almost doomedly negative without any variables:

> - They themselves as parents will be no improvement in their future;
> - Their children were unwittingly turned into "people who have always been passive to themselves"...

The correct choice would have been:

> - Parents should take the initiative to make themselves better and better;
> - Make the child want to become better because of admiration, and then the child will take the initiative, even if only the surface imitation is a good start...

You see, the **right choice is always harder to implement.**

Another most common example is people's attitudes about ethical requirements. The object of morality and the object of restriction should be oneself, not others. It is right to hold high morality on yourself; but it is usually too naive or preoccupied to impose morality to others. The law is used to require everyone, not only to require for themselves, but also to require others - again, because it is restricting yourself and others, which is everyone; therefore, using the weapon of law to defend your rights and interests often is difficult. You can think carefully about why.

If you start a Regular Investment, you become an investor with certain attributes. Then you will meet in batches of investors who are different from yours. They are all talking about the companies they are investing in, and they are really eager to make suggestions. In the end, they will often get angry and even get angrier till they cannot eat and sleep well. Why did they become like that? Because they don't know that they are outside their own active boundaries; they don't know that outside their boundaries, their own initiative is useless, and if it is, it's all negative. They will never understand, because they simply cannot have the ability to make an effective business model and ultimately get the public's investment. If they actually do it, they will know how terrible things are that so many people outside want to influence themselves, and how terrible it is if they are so easily influenced by the outside world.

**The second boundary of the initiative is the control range** . In fact, we can really control things like the temperature of the air conditioner, the speed of the car, etc... Even the subsequent discussions will show you what we can control far beyond your imagination... However, **it's more important to identify things that you can't control** . For example, pure luck is something that no one can control...

In some cases, the technique plays a 100% role; at the other extreme, only luck plays a 100% role. Between the two extremes, the skill and luck are different...

The above image is from the book published by *Michael J. Mauboussin* in 2012: **The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing** .

It is easy to observe:

> - The vast majority of people are not working hard within their own active boundaries;
> - More people are fooling themselves from outside their own active boundaries...

Therefore, the vast majority of life dilemmas can be attributed to:

> - Not active enough when they should;
> - Over active when they should not.

Think about it, is this the case?

The world has no special care for any individual. It is called "the **world is not benevolent, and everything is a dog** ." Thus, from a probabilistic point of view, most people are unlikely to be overly satisfied with the surroundings they are in. Therefore, most people initially have a lot of willingness to change their surroundings - until they finally give up and then give up.

What is wrong for those who finally gave up? They just don't understand the essence of influence: influence is not what you say initiatively, or what you do on your own initiative... ** The essence of influence is: Whether what you do can trigger the initiative of others?** Deng Xiaoping knew this well – and precisely because of this, he changed the whole of China. Please understand this sentence carefully. The most cherished by the people who voted is their ability to make money outside the field, because that is the basis for all growth. Sales is a strong off-market ability to make money. People who are good at selling understand the nature of influence, and people who use the initiative outside the active boundaries are all boring sales. Your experience in the future will make you more and more aware of this.
