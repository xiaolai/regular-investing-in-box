## 3. The only correct way for ordinary people to invest is Regular Investment

Let me directly say the conclusion:

> In the magical place of exchange market, **the only correct way for ordinary people to invest is automatic investment**-Remember this!

Since [BOX](https://b.watch), the first blockchain ETF on the earth, has just been established (July 3, 2019, the so-called “seven-three leek festival” of the “Double-Eleven”) and its data is not long enough, so it cannot be used as the modeling example to explain the only reliable way of investing for ordinary person.

The predecessor of the [Longmen Fund](http://www.longmen.fund/) (https://longmen.fund) was the Bit Fund, which was founded by Li Xiaolai in 2013. It was liquidated in 2018. Some investors decided to continue after five years. So, the ETF product, Longmen Fund, was created. The Longmen Fund is not open to the public. Currently, only a small number of invited people who are qualified can invest.... However, because it has long-term transparent data, it can be used here as an example of bidding.

The following is a screenshot of the Longmen Fund website in early July 2019:

In order to use this data as an example of a fixed vote, we only take a look at the data for each month:

![longmen.smiling.curve.tb](../images/longmen.smiling.curve.tb.png)

Suppose you start from September 2018 and set a monthly investment of $1,000 for Longmen Capital. It has been scheduled for 11 months... Then, the data is as follows:

In other words, in the case of a monthly fixed vote, you will miss the highest point, $92 on June 25, 2019; you will also miss the lowest point, $23 on December 15, 2018... But, finally your average price is $54, and the current price is around $85. After 11 months, you have invested a total of $11,000; and your current book value is $19,141.44 - even if it is based on the price you made last time, $82 - even $1 less than that of from the previous month... However, your  yield has been **74.01%** !

Looking at the picture below, you can see more clearly the relationship between the principal you invested and the current income:

In the 11-month data of the above Longmen Fund, the price curve draws a fascinating “smile curve”.

The people who adopt a Regular Investment strategy in the market are always a minority, and the so-called " smile curve " above is likely to be a diametrically opposite " wretched curve " for those who have not adopted a Regular Investment strategy. It is definitely not a kind smile, but the evil smile of the clown you saw in the Batman story - his mouth is still gloomy: "Why so serious?"

Now look at the data again, assuming that your investment method is the kind that most people love to do, the so-called "a shuttle"... Then, in September 2018, you will go in for $11,000 and then take after 11 months, there is no loss, because you will have about **10.81%** of the proceeds! —— Although it is far away from **74.01%** , there is no loss after all!

However, according to the nature of your special love of a shuttle, the possibility that you can keep it all the way after 11 months is actually not big. why? For a shuttle, this curve is definitely a wretched curve.

Don't say the next month, every day, every moment, every moment, you will be extremely anxious. For the next six months, your only feeling is that your assets are shrinking every minute.

Pain and happiness are not symmetrical. Our genes determine our feelings. The pain of losing 10 dollars is far greater than the happiness of earning 10 dollars. You feel absolutely like you are being smashed by the evil clown, and watching him spit out his tongue, listening to his gloomy mutter, why are you doing it...

If you are an investor with a Regular Investment approach, then you are in a completely different world – although they look exactly the same, although most people except you can’t understand your feelings because all the feelings are the opposite.

** Regular Investment is the behavior to use of your own long-term period to support something**. So, since you have gambled on your own future, then you have thought through it when you choose. Therefore, the price generated after the first purchase falls, and every decline is the time for you to lower the average price. A shuttle man is there to experience the cold winter, shivering, but you are the opposite, you are refreshed, you add more low-priced chips for you and feel happy...

A shuttle man can't stand the pain for too long - in fact, no one can suffer for a long time. This has nothing to do with the so-called "strong". From another point of view, this is not stupid, it is just ignorance. After a month of pain, or two months, or three months, or even afterwards, it seems to be going to pass, which is, in the sixth month (or before), many people will be based on various reasons for leaving - This kind of behavior is called "cutting meat" in the trading market... You see, the leek is cutting itself, and the bloody meat is cut.

What about you who are fixed investment? Are you insisting? No! It should be like that! If in the process, you look at the low-priced chips but you are stopped by people, you will fight with him - blocking people's money, like killing parents. Don't you agree? Are you cold? Are you shivering? You can't feel it! You are excited, every time you make a vote, you are very excited, because every time the average price is reduced is equivalent to "**moving your admission time forward**" - you will not be as annoyed as many half-hangers every day, "Hey! what if I knew this earlier!" Or "How do I know?" They all think that they are late... You are different, you know that your behavior is constantly ahead of your relative admission time.

After six months, the price began to climb slowly... Do you think that the person who left the market by cuttingmeat at the beginning will rush into this shuttle at this time? Will not. They are afraid of death - the experience of being born before death will make their expectations of fear stronger. So, almost 100% probability of happening is that they are hesitating, and they don’t have any chips in their hands to watch the price rise... When they fall, they run because they are afraid of death, and now they are more afraid when they rise. — Until their moods collapse, the price may be already high. When they start the next wretched curve, they are actually entering the market...

For them, reincarnation is terrible, because no matter how they do, they feel a malicious world. With the previous explanations, it is very simple to explain now, because for them, the price curve of any investment target is composed of countless wretched curves. How terrible are you saying such a fate?

You see, obviously the same world, but people may feel the opposite; is this amazing? If you are a person with a Regular Investment strategy, then, for a moment, the same world is another way for you, because the price curve you face is made up of countless smile curves! In this world, happiness is inherently rare and scarce. I will ask you, is this kind of happiness that cannot be told to people more scarce and more precious?
