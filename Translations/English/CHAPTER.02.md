## 2. The stock exchange market is the ninth wonder of the world

There are many types of investable targets, such as gold, antiques, art, real estate, early startups, and listed companies... Maybe you don’t know that in the highly developed financial world, even trendy shoes are investable subject.

However, here we are talking about investment, particularly the automatic investment, which means:

> **Stocks of listed companies that are available for purchase and trade on the trading market, or those that are developing in the next generation of stock exchanges that can purchase tradable blockchain digital assets.**

In my opinion, the traditional **stock exchange market** is definitely worthy of being called **the ninth wonder** of the world. In addition to the recognized seven wonders of the world, Einstein once called " **complex interest** " **the eighth wonder of the world** .

The stock exchange market provides an excellent opportunity for ordinary people to have without it. What opportunity? **The opportunity to getting rid of class solidification.**

Why do you say that? We are attracted to all kinds of entrepreneurial stories every day, because the protagonist in the story is said to be from the grassroots but eventually completes the counterattack, becoming the founder, leader of the unicorn, or the chairman of the listed company... These protagonists are no longer restricted by the problem of hierarchy solidification; but the problem is that this is not a good path for ordinary people. Since the facts have proved that they can create such great business value, they are not ordinary people - they are extremely good people, whether they are from grassroots or not, whether they are poor in the early or not, success itself is just proof that they are inherently successful. People. Subsequent discussions will also allow you to clearly see a cold fact:

> Even those who are so good and work hard, the ultimate success depends more on luck - they have to have enough good luck to get the support of the trend.

Even if you work in a listed company, you can't get rid of your luck. It is definitely luck to join in the early days of a company that can be listed in the future. However, if you look at the examples, you will understand that when the company goes public, the probability of keeping up with the concept, ability, and relationship and being reused is actually very, very low. Before such a good company is about to go on the market, even if getting a job there is not something that ordinary people can do. The age is just right, the education is enough, and the ability is just right for the company. You can ask those people working in a listed company and then you can understand that in addition to the pressure, how many of them actually hold the company's stock? Without the company's stock, it means that no matter how hard you try, the company's development has no real relationship with yourself.

However, because there is a stock exchange, no matter who it is - regardless of national boundaries, regardless of region, regardless of race, regardless of gender, regardless of age, regardless of height, weight, thinness, ugliness, regardless of sexual orientation - — You can buy the stocks of the best companies in the world at any point in time, and let your money continue to grow with the best companies in the world 24 hours a day – this is the real quality of “fighting” ! What is especially striking is that under normal circumstances, as investors, these ordinary people do not need to do anything extra! The most amazing thing is that buying stocks of the best companies in the world has almost no threshold!

Ordinary people's money is unlikely to have any effective value-added opportunities, because ordinary people find it difficult to create real business value. Only a very small number of people in the crowd is trying their best to create business value in order to change their own destiny, and finally succeeded. Enterprises in the stock exchange market, although there are also garbage companies, are all enterprises that are strictly selected according to certain standards. Most of the people in the crowd who are really good at creating business value are concentrated there.

As long as ordinary people buy their stocks of good companies with their own money, it means that ordinary people are instantly upgraded to bosses, and those who create business value most are working for these ordinary people - even those ordinary people must be incompetent bosses.

People always think that "choose stocks" is a very difficult thing - in fact, it is not difficult at all ! Because the so-called "difficulties" are entirely caused by inertial thinking. In fact, it is only the result of people who are unwilling or afraid to use the simplest and most rude and effective methods. This method is too simple to be believable:

> **Directly choose the stocks that everyone in the market is most optimistic about.**

Pay attention to the word "most". In Shenzhen Stock Exchange, you will buy Vanke directly. In the Shanghai Stock Exchange, you will buy directly from Guizhou Moutai. On Nasdaq, you will buy Apple directly. At the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, you will buy Tencent directly. At the blockchain exchange, you will buy BitCoin……

This is the essence of the magic of the trading market – here **you can harness the wisdom of others.**

As you have seen just now, ordinary people can make the best people in the world's best companies help them make money with very little money! Do you know what is more magical? Even more amazing is that you can make the smartest people in the entire market choose for you. Don't you say you can't do it? Don't you think you don't understand it? Don't you think you are stupid? Don't you need to spend a lot of time to learn even if you are not stupid? In fact, you think too much, because these are not important - don't you admire Buffett? Then you go directly to buy the stock of the company he is holding, which is equivalent to let Buffett think for you for free... Of course, Buffett is not necessarily the best, then what should I do? You can directly select the target that everyone is optimistic about. This is what I just said, Vanke, Maotai, Apple, Tencent, and Bitcoin are the varieties that the smartest people on the market have already chosen for you – and the advice of these smartest people is completely free!

There is no doubt about this zero-cost judgment. If the most optimistic target in the whole market is defeated in the end, in fact, you have nothing to complain about - because that is already the best advice! By the same token, when China Tobacco was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2019, you can buy it directly! Because that is the most cash-producing company in China!

Do you know what is the most amazing? This simplest most straightforward rude and absolutely effective method is not adopted by 99% of people! If you look at the data, you know how amazing this "most amazing" is. According to the statistics of March 31, 2019, the total number of shareholders of Kweichow Moutai (600519) was 80,594. In the same period, the number of open accounts in China's stock market was about 150 million... almost five over ten thousand. And there are many institutional investors, which means, among ordinary people, perhaps only less than one in ten thousand people dare to use this simple and straightforward but extremely effective principle.

If you choose the most optimistic target on the market, what is the effect of this? Do you know? Next, you don't need to research, you don't need to analyze, you don't need to look at it alone, you don't even need to talk to anyone at all; in fact, you don't have to do anything, because all of this is the smartest on the market. The smartest individuals have done for you, and it is free! - This is definitely the highest level of investors in the modern trading market. Rumor has said that the life of Maotai shareholders is also very simple, which is reading, doing fitness, traveling, and accompanying family... This is indeed true.

So, shouldn't the stock exchange market be called the ninth wonder of the world? Whichever it is, anyway, it is a miraculous existence.

If the traditional stock exchange market can be called the ninth wonder of the world, then the blockchain trading market must be called the tenth wonder of the world. The blockchain exchange is a subversive version of the traditional stock exchange market – you can see the amazing subversion from a single point:

> - There are already tens of thousands of blockchain digital asset exchanges around the world;
> - They form a trading kingdom that is not resting every day, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, never ending;
> - The number of future traders comes from all over the world...

Apple is now a trillion-dollar market capitalization company. In the past 52 weeks, the daily trading volume of Apple stocks was 28,834,582. According to the price of July 2019, the daily trading volume of Apple stock is about 5.77 billion dollar.

Bitcoin's market capitalization on July 10, 2019 was about $224.7 billion, less than a quarter of Apple's; however, Bitcoin's day trading volume was $29.47 billion, five times the amount of Apple's stock trading. Moreover, this difference is not ordinarily big, right? And the market value of only more than 5 billion US dollars EOS is only 1 / 200 of Apple's market value, but how much is its daily trading volume? It’s $2.3 billion, approaching 1/2 of Apple’s stock trading volume... Isn't this amazing? In the foreseeable future, this difference can only grow bigger and bigger.

This explains why blockchain digital assets are more worth investing than stocks if they are more worthwhile than bonds.
