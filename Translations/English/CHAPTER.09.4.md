## 9. The profound mechanism behind the magical power of the Regular Investment strategy

Let us start with a pair of concepts that seem to be opposite:

> **Active** and **Passive**

In general, active and passive are considered to be antonyms. “Active” is generally understood to be positive, while relatively “passive” is often understood as negative.

### 9.4 The optimal strategy for driving the trend can only be actively passive.

Being active is of course important – within the boundaries of the initiative. However, another fact that most people ignore is:

> **Being passive is even more important!**

The importance of being active is often easily understood once explained a little; the importance of passiveness is difficult to make clear, because it is necessary to communicate in advance the "active boundary", a concept that many people have never seriously thought about.

Once we start to study the **trend** , we will realize **the huge energy of passiveness** - not knowing how to adapt to passive energy is the death point of most people's life. Many people can't help using inappropriate wording, for example, “driving the trend” – how can the trend be driven? The trend of this thing exists objectively outside the active boundary of anyone. The "driving" of this kind of active behavior has no effect on the trend, as it is only the wishful thinking of people. Therefore, the more appropriate wording should be, "**comply with the trend**", you see, "compliance" is passive, because outside the active boundary, passiveness has a very powerful and very magical power.

If you have to use the word "driving", it is not impossible, because there is indeed a small number of people who finally find the optimal strategy of "driving the trend" through a lot of proactive thinking:

> **Actively passive**

What is **actively passive** ?

> - **Actively** choose the most correct trend;
> - **Passively** wait for the trend to work...

The vast majority of things that people think are choices are actually worthless. In the morning, choose which pair of shoes to wear, or which color to choose from, or whether to take the train or the plane, etc... In fact, these trivial things cannot cause any influence outside the active boundary, and the most change is just self-feeling. However, people are so obsessed with self-feeling... Since they are so obsessed with self-feeling, they then feel good about themselves. The result of being abandoned by the trend after many years is not acceptable, because people who are obsessed with self-feeling can always find the best excuses, for example, the big environment is not good.

**The root cause of the vast majority of mediocrity can be attributed to the waste of time and energy on choices that are not related to the trend.** It's the same for anyone: the most important decisions in life are three or five. Studying, marriage, and career, do you want to give more two decisions that are more important than theirs? Of course, you must have one more than others now: **Regular Investment** . This is a key advancement, and the difficulty and significance of which is equivalent to the "gene mutation" in biological evolution.

Whether a decision is significant and meaningful can be measured by looking at only one metric:

> **Is it a choice for trends?**

Actively choosing the most correct trend is easier said than done.

The reason why it is obvious is that people can't give up trivia things. Even they think that if they don't live like that, then they will not have a life. There is no other way, so they still choose to give up the trend and then accept the fate of helplessness sooner or later.

Before you control the trend, you must grasp the trend; you must study the trend before you grasp the trend; you must feel the trend before you study the trend... People who have spent all their time and energy all day long can be occasionally told that a certain trend is happening - and because they have more trivial things to deal with, so even after being told, there is no time to go deep into the feelings, let alone study and grasp... As for driving, it must be beyond their destiny.

So they have that kind of confusion, and always encounter the same embarrassment:

> Why am I one step late?

However, the next time they are destined to be the same situation.

In many cases, especially in the trading market, “to come late” has never been a problem. If you can still recall the trading curve that can be called “smile curve” and “wretched curve” at the same time, you can understand that the fixed investors can spend one after another through their long-term stable and continuous voting behavior. The behavior and strategy determine the fact that "**whenever you enter the market is right.**" Every time they spend a smile curve, they are “**shifting forward**” their admission time by a large segment – because the average cost is reduced! Contrary to those who are not fixed investors, they not only mistakenly believe that they can have lower costs only if they enter earlier, but they will further "**panning backward**" their own entering time, because the same curve becomes a wretched curve.

After Facebook went public, its stock has risen many times. Can it be said that a person must become Peter Tiel to have the opportunity to invest in Facebook to make a lot of money? no! You don't have Peter Tiel's connections, fame, capital, ability, so even if you live in Silicon Valley, you can't be an angel investor of Mark Zuckerberg; but then Facebook is listed, if you are there When I bought Facebook stock, even if Facebook went out with a sloppy, broken market, then it was obviously a smile curve! No matter how many people are finally smashed by the wretched curve, stepping on the ground and rubbing friction with the pace of the devil, as long as you really understand the truth of the Regular Investing, no matter where you are from as ordinary people, it turns out that the strategy of this action will bring hundreds of times return!

In the eight years of the blockchain world, I have seen countless early visitors. Have they still held today? Obviously not. Even if you enter early, if you don't have the right strategy - Don't be suspicious, there is only one reliable strategy to be, which Regular Investment. Then, after eight years, when you look back, you have been thrown out. Don't be arrogant or assertive, because it's a correct and realistic description. The strategy of Regular Investment seems to be too simple to be favorable. People like fancy things that look fashionable, complicated, and high-end – to put on their own (ie, within the boundaries of the initiative), dressing is like this; however, things that are not plain will incur catastrophic disaster, if these things are applied to the active boundary. In the second half of 2018 to the first half of 2019, a large number of so-called "quantitative funds" in the market collapsed. In the second half of 2018 and in the first half of 2019, two famous people committed suicide -Pretentious people cannot bear the failure of what they actively caused.

Therefore, in order to be actively passive, the first step to start is to **give up the trifle** . The metric is simple: **everything that has nothing to do with the trend is trivial.** After giving up everything, the rest is natural. Because only in this way, we can clearly think, and then distinguish where to take the initiative, where should be passive, in order to truly understand what is called **active passive** .
