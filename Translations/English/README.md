## Foreword

I guess, as an ordinary person, you must have heard a horrified word more than once: **class solidification** .

No matter whether the solidification of the hierarchy really exists, whether it is really forming or not, it is definitely a vocabulary that makes ordinary people feel tight when they hear it. I don't know how others feel. Anyway, I clearly remember the feeling that the younger one was worried about it for the first time when he heard the vocabulary for the first time - it was not fear, it seemed desperate.

This vocabulary is a source of anxiety for many people around the world. It’s not that you are afraid of it alone, and that you are not alone in facing it. Sooner or later, you will know that Koreans and Japanese have long accepted the status quo that their society has solidified. You will also hear that even Americans with different American dreams have experienced it to varying degrees. The solidification of the class is taking shape, not to mention the domestic media. They like to die. This natural untouched title can cause the anxiety of most people... The articles talking about this term are all worried, helpless, and provide no feasible solution after all the nagging.

This book is about the **path of }ordinary people getting rid of class solidification** - absolutely feasible, no water, and it depends on yourself. The **ordinary people** mentioned here are regardless of national boundaries, regardless of region, regardless of race, regardless of gender, regardless of age, regardless of height, weight, thinness, beauty, ugliness, regardless of sexual orientation... The key is that even IQ and education do not matter! In other words, this solution is applicable even to the little bustle boy who ran errands in Beijing...

It's hard to believe that there is such a solution. Even more incredible is that the solution speaks only two words:

> **Regular Investment**

**Investment** is the only way I can find a common person who can cross the hierarchy. And **Regular Investment** is the only investment method that all ordinary people have the opportunity to do and have the ability to do well.

> The so-called Regular Investment is to invest a certain amount of money on a certain investment target for a long time.

For example, in the next **5-10 years in** (a long time), **weekly** (regularly) investment **[BOX](https://b.watch)** that no management fee of block chain ETF products (investment target) **of $ 150 or 1000 yuan** (a certain amount)... Of course, you can replace the [BOX](https://b.watch) with any target that is worth investing in and holding for a long time, such as Apple stock, Kweichow Moutai stock, Coca-Cola stock, or Standard & Poor's index fund.

In any society, in any era, the vast majority of people are in a state of lifelong complaints. However, in today's era—the era of **today's free and mature stock exchanges** —the vast majority of people who complain all their lives don't know that each of them (yes, everyone) is actually missing the opportunity to get rid of all the complaints because of ignorance.

The freely-participated stock exchange market is a miracle in today's modern world – precisely because of its existence, all ordinary people have the supreme opportunity – as discussed in detail in this book.

Few books that can advertise like this:

> The "**cost of emptying**" for ordinary people who miss the book is **infinite**...

I haven't been exaggerated - although this is indeed self-selling, the melon that Lao Li sells is really delicious!

Please read on!

...... Not only that, **but after reading** it, you have to {strong1}read it again and again{/strong1}, until you decide to start investing, until if someone dares to stop you from letting you invest, you can't wait to be desperate with him - I know, you really understand. It must be like this.
