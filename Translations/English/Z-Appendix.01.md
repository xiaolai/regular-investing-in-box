## 1. Why invest in blockchain digital assets?

In theory, a Regular Investment strategy can be used to invest in many targets. In the next decade, one of the targets that has not received widespread attention in the past is blockchain digital assets.

Let's talk about Bitcoin first. Bitcoin is the first digital asset on the planet to apply blockchain technology, and there is no doubt about it. Bitcoin has been controversial over the past decade. Each round of price increases and falls will be repeatedly declared dead - Bitcoin has been declared dead at least 364 times so far. You can remember this URL, which records the history of bitcoin that has been collected in history.

Many people like to play with new vocabulary, and will tell you expertly that bitcoin has now gained consensus... and so on. Regarding the technical details of Bitcoin, I need to use another special class to explain. However, it is clear from this point that in blockchain technology, the word "consensus" refers to the consensus between the machine and the machine, rather than the consensus between people. .

There is no standard communication agreement between people, and there is almost no way to produce a valid consensus. It’s not that there is no consensus, and the only consensus among people of all kinds that I can think of is making money. Besides that, there is no consensus among people. Therefore, in the future, please don't confuse the special terminology, as it is easy to reveal what you really know.

The reason why Bitcoin is so powerful is not because of the "price consensus". So what is it? To illustrate this point, I have to create a vocabulary that is called "**all difficult to rebut**." What is "all difficult to rebut?" Even if you accept or nor, the key is that everyone can hardly deny it. This is called "all difficult to rebut".

Therefore, it is not awesome when all "people accept", but "**all difficult to rebut**" - that is, no one can deny the fact. The reason why Bitcoin is so powerful is not because one day it will be accepted by everyone. Believe me, that is impossible. Is the dollar so powerful? You eat big food stalls in Beijing night market, and try to pay in US dollars? In most cases it will not be accepted. However, no one will seriously value the dollar.

Now that Bitcoin has reached this point, it is no matter of what, if it rises or falls, it will be "all difficult to rebut". Today, ten years after the birth of Bitcoin, the value of blockchain technology has long had an attribute that is difficult. And the value-added trend of digital assets based on blockchain technology is equally difficult – the most important reason for investing in blockchain digital assets.

Eight years ago, the reason I started investing in Bitcoin was simple:

> We've seen how the Internet has changed the world by dramatically reducing the cost of information flow (down to near zero); if there is something that can dramatically reduce asset flow costs (down to near zero), then The world must have undergone tremendous changes - as for how much change can't be imagined, just as we couldn't imagine the Internet changing the world like it was today. Therefore, if the investment in the Internet was correct in the past, then it is right to invest in the blockchain. Before that, it was the "information Internet". Now this is the "financial Internet."

Today, eight years later, Bitcoin is no longer the " **social experiment**" of the year. It has long been a " **social practice**." The trend of continuous development is not only difficult, but more importantly, this trend is long and long.

Bitcoin, according to the plan of its white paper, has to be dug up to 2140 years... Ten years ago, I saw such a plan and thought it was a fantasy. However, now that ten years have passed, Bitcoin is no longer an "experimental" but a "practice". Then, this runway has 120 years! Basically it exceeds the limits of life for all today's audience. Therefore, I think I can't find a longer runway at all.

More importantly, however, today, ten years later, there are more than one digital asset assets in the blockchain that can be invested. When I entered the market, there was only one target, which was Bitcoin. In the years that followed, although there were thousands of altcoins, including the still-active Litecoin today, there is only one that is reliable in my eyes, Bitcoin.

When there is only one investment target, one thing can't be solved: the **opportunity cost cannot be diluted.**

Now it's different. Now that there are a lot of reliable investment targets, then we have the means to complete this important investment strategy by investing in a series of targets: dilute the opportunity cost. This is a very important investment strategy, but unfortunately most of the so-called investors do not have this basic concept at all.

This is why I want to design and launch a package of solutions to the underlying [BOX](https://b.watch). In the existing traditional financial market, this kind of investment target is called ETF, Exchangable Trading Fund. This concept can't be justified from the term, but you can understand it through the basic properties of the ETF:

> - Lock a series of targets in a basket;
> - Equipped with a marketable vouchable Token to anchor the value of this basket;
> - Under certain conditions, the Token holder can redeem the corresponding target in the basket by returning the token.

[BOX](https://b.watch) is such an ETF.
