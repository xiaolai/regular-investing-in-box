## 4. Is there any investment target that only rises not falls?

As an ordinary person, when you realize the magic of the trading market, find out that there is a way to let the world's smartest people work for your money without threshold, and let the world's smartest people help you choose the best investment for free, although it is not necessary to be smug, there is absolutely no need for a hint of inferiority. Because the vast majority of so-called investors in the trading market are half-baked – even the vast majority of investment managers in suits are half-hangers...

If you don't believe it, I can quickly teach you a very effective trick.

When you meet any guy who plays an expert in front of you, you can ask an understatement:

> ... How do you dilute the opportunity cost?

Usually, you will find that the other person will instantly diverge his pupils in his eyes, and his mouth will start to flash his words... If you do not believe, just try it!

When we adopt the free best advice provided by all the smart people on the market, we will face another trick, which is if we only buy Vanke, or just buy any one of Guizhou Maotai, Apple, Coca-Cola and even Chinese Tobacco, we face a serious problem:

> **The opportunity cost of investing only a single target is unlimited!**

This is definitely a concept that any ordinary person can understand!

The so-called opportunity cost means that if your money is used to invest in a certain target, the money cannot be used to invest in another target at the same time... If you invest A with some money, then the money cannot be simultaneously used to invest in B, then B's future gains will become the opportunity cost of the future earnings of your investment A.

If you only invest in the only target, then your opportunity cost is infinite! Therefore, even if it is a greenhorn, you can instantly understand why you must find a way to dilute the opportunity cost! Invesment is a comprehensive thinking technology. You can't just consider the possible rate of return. In addition, you must also consider the risk... And “**how to dilute the opportunity cost**” is also an important factor that must be considered!

Is there a way? there must be! An easy way is to invest in a range of quality targets. When you buy an index fund or an ETF, your investment target is no longer a quality company or project, but a series of quality companies or projects!

There is a subtle focus here that has been overlooked by many people. By purchasing a range of quality targets, you effectively dilute the opportunity cost on the one hand, and on the other hand, the attributes and quality of your investment target have changed! **Your investment target has become the target of only rising and not falling in the long run**!

Is it so amazing? Absolutely.

It is very, very difficult for high-quality companies to achieve long-term success. Even good companies are likely to decline. You have heard of Kodak and you have heard of Nokia. Companies such as Coca-Cola and Kweichow Moutai are extremely rare, and even they might face the Black Swan event and face the disaster. Therefore, investing only in one of the best companies, on the one hand, has an infinitely high opportunity cost. On the other hand, there is no effective way to circumvent the black swan event. The farther it is,the more it is.

However, does the world have the target of rising and not falling in the long run? some! That is **the economic development of mankind**.

This is also why in the long run, the price index of the stock market has only one trend, rising. The short-term ups and downs constitute one after another smile curve (or wretched curve). When all are spliced together, there is only one trend, rising, even if there is definitely ups and downs in the middle, and finally, it will rise.

The following is a price trend chart for the S&P 500 index over the past 40 years (1979 to 2019):

Therefore, when you invest in a series of high-quality targets, what you “gamble” is no longer a certain enterprise. The target of your “gambling” actually becomes the whole economic development... You bought a series of high quality standards in the Chinese stock market, then you are actually betting on China's overall economic development! You bought a series of high-quality targets on the US stock market, then you are actually betting on the overall economic development of the world - because excellent companies from all over the world are likely to go public in the US! You bought a [BOX](https://b.watch) (there are three high-quality assets in the blockchain world, BTC, EOS, XIN), then you are no longer betting on Bitcoin, or a blockchain project. What you actually "gamble" is the development of the entire blockchain industry.

Therefore, when I designed the [BOX](https://b.watch), the most important consideration is the development of the blockchain technology. The blockchain technology development route that I have said in many places:

> Trusted Account Book → Trusted Code → Trusted Execution Environment → Trusted Device...

Historically, I certainly didn't miss Bitcoin in 2011; in 2016, I did not actually miss Ethereum; in 2017, I was the angel investor of EOS, the hottest blockchain project with a market value of more than $5 billion in 2019. Similarly, the MIXIN Network is also a project of my heavy position - if it is once or twice, it may be good luck; if it is repeated again and again, or even four or four times, it is not only good luck, right? Logic is the only tool available to humans in the face of the future. In this design, there is no secular selfishness, because [BOX](https://b.watch) designer Li Xiaolai does not charge management fees (this may be the world's first blockchain ETF that does not charge management fees), and, more importantly. Yes, Li Xiaolai can only make money by investing in [BOX](https://b.watch) under the same conditions as everyone else.

In fact, the real magic of the stock exchange market is here! Here, anyone can keep up with the economic development of the entire human race or society as a whole. The beauty of globalization is that ordinary people in Japan can buy American stocks to keep up with US economic development during the recession of the country; ordinary Americans can buy Chinese stocks when the US economy is stagflation to keep up with China's economic development; even if ordinary Chinese people are inconvenient to buy Japanese stocks and US stocks, and even buying Hong Kong stocks is not convenient... they can also invest in almost the world's almost ubiquitous blockchain trading with all ordinary people around the world. The market has kept up with the subversive rise and development of the financial Internet.

There is a secret focus here:

> There is no target that only rises not falls, and only the target that does not fall in the long run .

In the book "Self-cultivation for Leeks", I tried to correct a truth that most ordinary people misunderstand:

> - The trading market is indeed a zero-sum game in the real-time trading process - it seems that the opponent's profit comes from and is exactly equal to your loss.
> - The trading market is definitely not a zero-sum game for long-term investors – because their growth is mainly due to economic growth rather than short-term losses.

This is also why the only reliable investment method for ordinary people in the trading market is the core reason for the Regular Investment. On the other hand, as an ordinary person, you only have long-term investment and long-term holding is foolproof.

It is impossible for ordinary people to have a lot of money in the early days. However, by means of Regular Investment, ordinary people "gamble" their own ability to make money off-site and long-term fixed-term discipline. This is a big big stakes! Because your time is an absolutely exclusive asset, it can only be an asset with an infinite opportunity cost. So, when you use your best value, high-value assets with unlimited opportunity costs as an investment, you can only choose the target that is foolproof. What is it? It is the development of the entire economy of mankind. Apart from this, there is no other choice.

At the current point of time, the blockchain market is better than the stock market. The stock market is better than the real estate market. The real estate market may be better than the bond market. The bond market may be better than bank deposits... and the investment is ordinary people because of their own hands. I can't have too much money at the beginning, so I have to gamble on my future investment strategy. Therefore, when choosing the investment target, of course, I have to do everything I can to choose the best target. If at some point in the future, the optimal target is no longer the blockchain market, then you should switch to another best-selling market – this is not what the beliefs people often hang on their lips, this is Pragmatic values determine.

The result of this subtle choice will bring a magical feeling to you who think you are ordinary. You will be amazed at how you look and understand the facts that most people can't imagine:

> **The boundary of the clouds floating in the sky is actually irrelevant to the boundaries of the cities on the ground!**

When others are still listening to the weather forecast to judge the local weather today, you have already locked your eyes in the sky, and find ways to know in advance which piece or which clouds will rain... **The realm** is obviously different! It doesn't even feel too much when using the fancy word of **ambition**...

Finally, there are more important key points to add:

> Regular Investment is a long-term continuous investment behavior, so the investment target must meet the "**long-term bullish**" attribute.

Therefore, if the property is extremely strict, then the conclusion is very obvious. Bonds, gold, real estate – not to mention the tidal shoes – are not qualified bids because they simply can't satisfy the attributes that must be met. From this perspective, you can immediately understand why Buffett is very careful about technology stocks, but he is very reassured about Coca-Cola...
